# Self Driving Simulation using CARLA AI

### Environment
The agent uses CARLA AI platform to using following Reinforcement Learning algorithms to train an AI model to keep a vehicle on the road and in between the lane markings
1. DQN with HER

### Sample Run
![video](sample.gif)


### Run Instructions
1.  Edit settings in settings.py
2.  Run with train.py
3.  You can just play using play.py.


### Future Work
1. Create models using other algorithms such as actor critic etc.
2. Add functionality to train and drive card towards a specified destination
